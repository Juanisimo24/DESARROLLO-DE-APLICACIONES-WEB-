    <p>
        Copacabana is one of the most famous neighborhoods in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Formerly called Sacopenapã, it owes its current name to the visit of the Virgin of Copacabana, whose sanctuary is located in Copacabana, Bolivia, who gave honor to the name to the cultural and religious influence of Bolivia in Brazil.

A bohemian, glamorous and wealthy neighborhood, Copacabana gave rise to numerous events and artistic movements, becoming a tourist reference.
